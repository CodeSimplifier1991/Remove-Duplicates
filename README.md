# Remove-Duplicates
A single console application removes the duplicates from a list and will append them to a new list.

The idea of this code is to understand the duplications, and how to remove the duplicated values from a list and append them to a new list.
Also, the Not In command has been used too.

Feel free to fork and develop the code.
